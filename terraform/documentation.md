# Terraform Infrastructure Documentation

This document provides a short overview of how the Terraform infrastructure for Bro AI is implemented and organized.

## Overview

The Bro AI infrastructure is built using Terraform to provision and manage Google Cloud Platform resources in a modular, scalable, and secure manner. The infrastructure supports multiple environments (production and staging) with appropriate configurations for each.

## Architecture Components

### Core Infrastructure Modules

1. **VPC Module** (`modules/vpc/`)
   - Creates isolated network infrastructure with public and private subnets
   - Implements security controls with firewall rules and Cloud NAT
   - Provides secondary IP ranges for Kubernetes pods and services
   - Enables Private Google Access for secure service communication

2. **Kubernetes Module** (`modules/kubernetes/`)
   - Provisions Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters with private nodes
   - Configures auto-scaling node pools with appropriate machine types
   - Enables Workload Identity for secure pod-to-service authentication
   - Implements network policies and security best practices

3. **PostgreSQL Module** (`modules/postgresql/`)
   - Creates Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instances with private IP configuration
   - Implements automated backup strategies with point-in-time recovery
   - Manages database users and additional databases
   - Integrates with Secret Manager for secure credential storage

4. **OAuth SSO Module** (`modules/oauth-sso/`)
   - Sets up Google Cloud Identity and OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Configures Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for application security
   - Manages service accounts and Workload Identity bindings
   - Handles secure storage of OAuth credentials

### Environment Configuration

**Production Environment** (`environments/prod/`)
- High-availability configuration with regional database deployment
- Production-grade machine types (e2-standard-2) with SSD storage
- Enhanced security controls including IAP and deletion protection
- Extended backup retention (30 days) and comprehensive monitoring

**Staging Environment** (`environments/stage/`)
- Cost-optimized configuration with smaller instance types
- Preemptible nodes and HDD storage for cost savings
- Reduced backup retention (7 days) and simplified monitoring
- Development-friendly access controls for easier testing

## Implementation Approach

### Infrastructure as Code Principles

The infrastructure follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices:

- **Modularity**: Reusable modules for different infrastructure components
- **Environment Separation**: Isolated configurations for prod and staging
- **State Management**: Remote state storage in GCS with locking
- **Version Control**: All infrastructure code is version controlled
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure changes through code only

### Security Implementation

Security is implemented through multiple layers:

- **Network Security**: Private subnets, firewall rules, and VPC isolation
- **Identity Management**: OAuth 2.0, IAP, and Workload Identity
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, private database access
- **Secret Management**: Google Secret Manager for all sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and least privilege principles

### Scalability Design

The infrastructure is designed for scalability:

- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling of GKE nodes and database resources
- **Load Distribution**: Regional deployment with traffic distribution
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sized instances with cost optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

## Key Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and management (v1.0+)
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Primary cloud provider
- **Google Kubernetes Engine**: Container orchestration platform
- **Cloud SQL PostgreSQL**: Managed database service (v15)
- **Google Cloud Identity**: Authentication and identity management
- **Secret Manager**: Secure credential storage and management

## Deployment Strategy

The infrastructure supports a multi-stage deployment approach:

1. **Backend Setup**: Initialize remote state management
2. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy and test in staging environment
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production with additional safeguards
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Operational Features

### Automation Tools

- **Setup Script** (`setup.sh`): Interactive infrastructure setup
- **Makefile**: Convenient commands for common operations
- **Terraform Modules**: Reusable infrastructure components
- **Environment Templates**: Standardized environment configurations

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Built-in GCP monitoring and alerting
- **Application Monitoring**: Container and application-level metrics
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging with structured log format
- **Security Monitoring**: Audit logs and security event tracking

### Backup and Recovery

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Infrastructure Backup**: Version-controlled Terraform state
- **Configuration Backup**: Git-based configuration management
- **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures and testing

## Cost Management

The infrastructure implements several cost optimization strategies:

- **Environment-specific Sizing**: Appropriate resource allocation per environment
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Preemptible Instances**: Cost-effective compute for non-critical workloads
- **Storage Optimization**: Appropriate storage classes for different data types
- **Budget Monitoring**: Automated cost tracking and alerting

## Getting Started

To deploy this infrastructure:

1. **Prerequisites**: Install Terraform and gcloud CLI
2. **Setup**: Run `./setup.sh` for interactive configuration
3. **Deploy**: Use `make deploy-stage` for staging or `make deploy-prod` for production
4. **Monitor**: Access GCP Console for monitoring and management

This infrastructure provides a robust, secure, and scalable foundation for the Bro AI application, implementing cloud native best practices and supporting rapid development and deployment workflows.
